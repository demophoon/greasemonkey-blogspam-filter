Blogspam Greasemonkey Script
============================

Version 0.1.0

This project was intended to be installed as a custom user script for skipping
all the blogspam on the internet starting with Gizmodo and taking you to the
original content itself.

* All Gizmodo sites are scanned for content on page load links are filtered out
  from the article until one final link can be determined and navigated to. In
  the event that multiple final links are left no action is taken by the
  script.
